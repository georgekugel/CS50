Implementation Details
For each of the following problems, you should write a single
SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem.
Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though
 you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should
 not assume anything about the ids of any particular songs or
 artists: your queries should be accurate even if the id of
 any particular song or person were different. Finally, each
 query should return only the data necessary to answer the
 question: if the problem only asks you to output the names
 of songs, for example, then your query should not also output
  each songâ€™s tempo.
