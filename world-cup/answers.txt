Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations increased, winning probabilities for most teams stabilized.
Notable changes in winning probabilities were observed for Switzerland, Denmark, and Brazil between 10 and 100 simulations.
Beyond 1000 simulations, predictions became more stable.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Considering the balance between accuracy and computational cost, running 1000 simulations can be considered "good enough"
as predictions become more stable and the total time taken is 0m0.011s, which is relatively low.
